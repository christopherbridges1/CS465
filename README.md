#**Architecture**

##Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
The different front end styles were used to perform different actions. Angular works well for dynamic content than can be refreshed and displayed instantly. Express is better for server rendered pages 

##Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDb was used for this application to allow storage in a JSON format that can be integrated into the Javascript programming. MongoDB allows for efficient querying and scales well to meet the needs of the application.

#**Functionality**

##How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? JSON differs from JavaScript in many different ways. JSON is a data format used for data storage and transfer, while JavaScript is a programming language used for logic and behaviors.

##Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
I used Angular components in many different views rather than duplicating code. The backend logic was modular and allowed me to test and manage the codebase much easier. Modular code allows for adaptability and reusability when creating larger and more complex programs. 

#**Testing**

##Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Testing a full stack application required validating API endpoints, methods, a layers of security. Different methods were used to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data. Every endpoint was tested to ensure proper functionality and efficiency. Postman was used for quick and effective API testing independent of the front end. Security added another layer of complexity to the testing. JSON web tokens require validation and authorization to access data. Security testing required using both admin and user-level accounts to ensure data integrity and role based access control. 


#**Reflection**

##How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has been very informative and educational. This was my first dive into Angular and Express. Learning the skills to make everything come together in one program was a great experience. The Front end skills I developed will integrate well with the backend knowledge I have gained so far in my studies.
